# LINQ Student Exercise

This exercise will help you practice using LINQ in C# with a list of students. You'll perform various operations using both **query syntax** and **method syntax**.

## 🧑‍🎓 Student List

```csharp
List<Student> students = new List<Student>
{
    new Student { Name = "Alice", Age = 17, Grade = 85, Class = "A" },
    new Student { Name = "Bob", Age = 18, Grade = 92, Class = "B" },
    new Student { Name = "Charlie", Age = 17, Grade = 70, Class = "A" },
    new Student { Name = "Diana", Age = 16, Grade = 95, Class = "B" },
    new Student { Name = "Evan", Age = 18, Grade = 60, Class = "C" },
    new Student { Name = "Fiona", Age = 17, Grade = 77, Class = "C" }
};
