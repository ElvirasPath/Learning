# Learning

This repository contains small projects created while learning the basics of programming, specifically focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to practice and apply new concepts through hands-on coding.

## Structure
Each project is organized into its own folder within the repository. A typical project folder includes:
- `index.html` â€“ The main HTML file
- `style.css` â€“ Styles for the project
- `script.js` â€“ JavaScript functionality (if applicable)
- A `README.md` (optional) explaining the project

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate into the Repository**
   ```sh
   cd learning
   ```
3. **Switch to the Main Branch and Pull Latest Changes**
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. **Create a New Branch for the Project**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b project-name
   ```
5. **Create a New Project Folder**
   ```sh
   mkdir project-name
   cd project-name
   ```
6. **Add Your Files**
   - Create an `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` file as needed.
   - Write code and test your project in a browser.

7. **Commit Your Work Frequently**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for project-name"
   ```
8. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**
   ```sh
   git push origin project-name
   ```
9. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub and create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.

10. **Switch Back to the Main Branch and Pull Latest Changes**
    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful file and folder names.
- Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separate for better organization.
- Write clean, readable code with comments where necessary.
- Create a new branch for every project and commit often.
- Use version control (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to track progress.
- Always switch back to the main branch and pull the latest changes before starting a new project.
- Follow standard formatting and linting rules.
- Document each project with a short `README.md` explaining what it does.
