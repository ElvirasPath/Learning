#Assignment Password Checker
A simple task for checking passwords using C#

##Program description:

1. The program asks the user to enter a password.
2. The input is stored in a variable
3. A loop is used to allow the user to re-enter the password if it does not meet the requirements.

###Conditions:

1. The password must be at least 5 characters long
2. The password must contain both uppercase and lowercase letters
3. The password must include at least one special character (!?.@:)

####Steps:

1. Create 3 booleans to check if password meets each condition (bool hasUpper; bool hasLower; bool hasSpecial; bool isLongEnough)
2. Create a string of the spesial characters allowed : string specialChars = "!?.@:"
3. Check each condition using if-else and a foreach loop(directly accesses every character) to check every character in the created password until the user creates a strong password

// 3.1. if password < 5 it will be immedialy rejected
// 3.2 if password => 5 the program will check it for remaining requirements : isLongEnough = true; hasUpper = true; hasLower = true; hasSpecialcharacters = true. If password doesn't meet all 3 conditions the program prints an error and asks for a new password.
